# Hello! Welcome to my blog!

I believe the best way to learn something is to teach it! To this end, I have decided to create a space wherein I can explain and explore the processes and concepts I encounter in my journey of learning and practising data wrangling, data science, and machine learning. I hope you enjoy yourself as you read my thoughts process on different issues about data science and machine learning.
